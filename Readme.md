# MTViewCenter2

MTViewCenter2 is a Framework project with it's main purpose in Representing a Common Interface for flexible managment of Manufacturing Processes.
It is created to introduce a Web Based 3D Visualisation of underground mining map and logical infrastructure interface.

The Focus is on :

  - strong Modularization
  - runtime Flexibility
  - efficient Data Managment
  - hight Performance

The Framework can be used to either simply create Custom Web Applications for the Browser, or as an extention, having data boundry to Business logic peers. The starting point for the user is to write his own plugins.
The core mainly takes care about the user following common Design Patterns ( e.g. Pub/Sub ).

### Current Version

2.1.5

### Tech

MTViewCenter2 uses a number of open source projects to work properly :

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [Grunt] - the streaming build system
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Jasmine] - the Testing environment

And of course MTViewCenter2 itself is open source with a [public repository] on GitHub.

### Installation

First clone (or Download and extract) the Repository and go to the Directory.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MineTronics/MTViewCenter2 MTViewCenter2
